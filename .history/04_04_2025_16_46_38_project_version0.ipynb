    "PLAI for short, led by Dr. Frank Wood has built a custom Minecraft server to collect real-time data on how individuals play and behave within the game world. However, running the Minecraft server involves real costs, such as software licensing, hardware, and human resources. To make the most of these investments, the team needs to focus on recruiting players who are most likely to generate a significant amount of usable data. \n",
    "This leads to our central research question: What skill set and age are most likely to contribute higher playing time?\n",

    "**ADD**: method summary \\\n",
    "To investigate which age group and skill set are most likely to contribute the most data, we conducted an exploratory and statistical analysis using the players.csv dataset. \n",
    "We began by loading the necessary libraries and reading in the dataset directly from its online source using the read_csv() function. After the data was loaded, we performed data wrangling and cleaning by selecting only the relevant columns: experience, played_hours, and age. We then used the filter() function to remove any rows containing missing values to ensure the integrity of subsequent analyses.\n",
    "Next, we prepared the data for exploratory data analysis. The experience variable was initially as a character and not a categorical variable(factor) so we turned it into factor using as_factor() function and then we converted its categories, which includes Beginner, Amateur, Regular, Veteran, and Pro into a numerical scale from 1 to 5 using fct_recode() and as.numerc() functions. This allowed us to analyze the data using visualizations that need numerical axis. The played_hours variable, which contains a wide range of values, was grouped into six categories based on the hours: minimal (0–1), trial (1–2), session (2–5), casual (5–30), moderate (30–100), and long_term (100+). Since the average number of hours played was around 6 and the maximum was 223 hours, we used narrower intervals for values under 10 hours, where most players are concentrated, and broader intervals for values above 10 hours to capture long-term players. These categories were created using the cut() function and were made to visualize broad time ranges and can be used for identifying trends within these time ranges.\n",
    "For the visualization of the dataset, we used ggplot to create a scatterplot .Our plot shows player age against skill level with different colors representing different categories of played_hours. This plot (Figure 1) helped us visually assess whether certain skill levels and age groups were associated with higher contribution. Also in order to better the presentation quality ,aesthetic qualities such as plot size,point size, transparency(alpha), and text size were adjusted.\n",
